//! Off-task FMP + FSP decrypt + delivery worker.
//!
//! First incremental step of the data-plane shard restructure (per the
//! architectural plan): each worker now **owns its session state
//! directly** in a local `HashMap`, with no `Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>`
//! cache on the Node side and no `Arc<Mutex<ReplayWindow>>` shared
//! with the rx_loop. The worker is the sole authority over the replay
//! window and the recv-side ciphers for every session it owns.
//!
//! Dispatch is **deterministic by session key**: rx_loop computes
//! `worker_idx = hash(cache_key) % N` and routes both
//! `RegisterSession` control messages and per-packet `Job` messages
//! through the same hash, so a session always lands on the same shard.
//!
//! Three message types travel through the per-worker `crossbeam_channel`:
//!
//! - **`RegisterSession`** — sent once on the first successful legacy
//!   decrypt for a session. Hands the worker an owned snapshot of the
//!   recv cipher + replay window for both FMP and FSP layers.
//! - **`Job`** — per-packet bulk decrypt + deliver. The worker looks
//!   up the session in its local HashMap; if absent (registration
//!   hasn't arrived yet, or session was unregistered), the packet is
//!   bounced back to rx_loop via the fallback channel.
//! - **`UnregisterSession`** — sent on rekey / peer drop so the worker
//!   releases the owned cipher + replay state.
//!
//! Only the **bulk-data** path (FMP DataPacket → FSP EndpointData) is
//! handled by the worker. Anything else (handshakes, MMP reports,
//! routing errors, IPv6-shim packets going to TUN) is bounced back to
//! the rx_loop via a fallback channel so the existing slow paths
//! continue to work.

// **Unix only at the call sites.** On Windows nothing constructs an
// `OwnedSessionState` or spawns the pool (see `lifecycle.rs`), so
// every field + function in here becomes dead. Silence the warnings
// rather than gate them individually.

    //
    // Two problems with that path:
    //   1. After the shard-owned-sessions refactor (01f6c62), the FSP
    //      replay window is owned by **this worker thread**. Once we
    //      `state.fsp_replay.accept(fsp_counter)`, the rx_loop's
    //      `noise::Session::replay_window` is stale — it still has
    //      old counters. When rx_loop tries to FSP-decrypt the
    //      bounced control frame, its legacy path's replay check
    //      passes (the counter wasn't in its window) but the AEAD
    //      tag check fails because the FSP bytes in `packet_data`
    //      were already decrypted in place (now plaintext + 16
    //      garbage tag bytes).
    //   2. Even if we didn't accept the worker's replay window for
    //      non-EndpointData, the in-place mutation of `packet_data`
    //      means the legacy path can't re-decrypt — the ciphertext
    //      is gone.
    //
    // The bug manifests in benches as link death: heartbeats never
    // make it through the worker, the link-dead timer fires at 30s,
    // peer is removed and re-handshakes, repeating forever.
    //
    // **Fix:** worker handles only the FMP layer. ALL link messages

    // with the FMP plaintext intact. The legacy rx_loop path does
    // FSP-decrypt as usual. Net cost vs the broken fast path: we
    // give up the rx_loop bypass for EndpointData, but the worker
    // still offloads the FMP AEAD (~half the per-packet decrypt
    // CPU). Correctness over micro-optimisation.
    //
    // The DataShard end-state (per the architectural plan) re-
    // introduces the EndpointData fast path correctly by having the
    // shard worker also own the rx_loop side for its sessions — at
    // that point there's no "rx_loop legacy path" for the worker to
    // conflict with.
    // Pass the buffer through by ownership + offset/length. No
    // per-packet allocation; rx_loop slices into `packet_data`.
